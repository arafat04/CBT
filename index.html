<h2>Explanation for Question 1</h2>
<p>
Any answer(s) you selected were correct. Multiple distortions are present:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All-or-nothing thinking:</strong> “I’m a total failure.”</li>
<li><strong>Overgeneralization:</strong> “I never do anything right.”</li>
<li><strong>Magnification:</strong> “I can’t stand it.”</li>
<li><strong>Labeling:</strong> Calling yourself a “slave” and your husband “a jerk.”</li>
</ul>
<p>
An overcooked roast does not define your worth. These thoughts exaggerate,
globalize, and mislabel a minor event.

    
Long answer:

    Now I will discuss the correct answers to this question so you can
get some immediate feedback. Any answer(s) you might have circled
was (were) correct. So if you circled anything, you were right! Here’s
why. When you tell yourself, “I’m a fofal failure,” you engage in all-
or-nothing thinking. Cut it out! The meat was a little dry, but that
doesn’t make your entire life a total failure. When you think, “I never
do anything right,” you are overgeneralizing. Never? Come on now!
Not anything? When you tell yourself, “I can’t stand it,” you are
magnifying the pain you are feeling. You're blowing it way out of
proportion because you are standing it, and if you are, you can. Your
husband’s grumbling is not exactly what you like to hear, but it’s
not a reflection of your worth. Finally, when you proclaim, “I work
like a slave and this is all the thanks I get! The jerk!” you are
labeling both of you. He’s not a jerk, he’s just being irritable and
insensitive. Jerky behavior exists, but jerks do not. Similarly, it’s silly
to label yourself a slave. You're just letting his moodiness sour your
evening.

    <h2>Cognitive Distortions — Definitions</h2>

    <p><strong>1. All-or-Nothing Thinking</strong><br>
    You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance falls short
    of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Overgeneralization</strong><br>
    You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Mental Filter</strong><br>
    You focus on one negative detail so intensely that your view of reality becomes darkened.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Disqualifying the Positive</strong><br>
    You reject positive experiences by insisting they “don’t count.”</p>

    <p><strong>5. Jumping to Conclusions</strong><br>
    You make negative interpretations without evidence.
    <br><em>Mind Reading:</em> Assuming others are reacting negatively.
    <br><em>Fortune Teller Error:</em> Predicting a negative outcome as fact.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization</strong><br>
    You exaggerate problems or shrink positive qualities.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Emotional Reasoning</strong><br>
    You believe that because you feel something, it must be true.</p>

    <p><strong>8. Should Statements</strong><br>
    You motivate with “shoulds,” “musts,” and “oughts,” leading to guilt or anger.</p>

    <p><strong>9. Labeling and Mislabeling</strong><br>
    You attach global negative labels instead of describing specific behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>10. Personalization</strong><br>
    You assume responsibility for negative events beyond your control.</p>
