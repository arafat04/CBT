<h1>Cognitive Distortions Self-Assessment Quiz</h1>

<div id="quiz"></div>

<div id="explanation">
<h2>Explanation for the First Scenario</h2>

<p>
Any answer(s) you selected were correct. Multiple distortions are present:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>All-or-nothing thinking:</strong> “I’m a total failure.”</li>
<li><strong>Overgeneralization:</strong> “I never do anything right.”</li>
<li><strong>Magnification:</strong> “I can’t stand it.”</li>
<li><strong>Labeling:</strong> Calling yourself a “slave” and your husband “a jerk.”</li>
</ul>

<p>
An overcooked roast does not define your worth. These thoughts exaggerate,
globalize, and mislabel a minor event.
</p>

<p>
When you tell yourself “I’m a total failure,” you engage in all-or-nothing
thinking. When you say “I never do anything right,” you are overgeneralizing.
When you say “I can’t stand it,” you are magnifying the pain. And when you
label yourself a slave and your husband a jerk, you are labeling rather than
describing specific behavior.

    <h2>Cognitive Distortions — Definitions</h2>

    <p><strong>All-or-Nothing Thinking</strong><br>
    Viewing things in black-and-white categories.</p>

    <p><strong>Overgeneralization</strong><br>
    Viewing a single negative event as a never-ending pattern.</p>

    <p><strong>Mental Filter</strong><br>
    Focusing exclusively on one negative detail.</p>

    <p><strong>Disqualifying the Positive</strong><br>
    Rejecting positive experiences as not counting.</p>

    <p><strong>Jumping to Conclusions</strong><br>
    Making negative interpretations without evidence.</p>

    <p><strong>Magnification / Minimization</strong><br>
    Exaggerating negatives or shrinking positives.</p>

    <p><strong>Emotional Reasoning</strong><br>
    Assuming feelings reflect facts.</p>

    <p><strong>Should Statements</strong><br>
    Using “shoulds” and “musts” to motivate or judge.</p>

    <p><strong>Labeling / Mislabeling</strong><br>
    Attaching global negative labels.</p>

    <p><strong>Personalization</strong><br>
    Assuming responsibility for events outside your control.</p>
